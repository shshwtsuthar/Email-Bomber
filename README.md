# Email-Bomber
In Internet usage, an email bomb is a form of sending large volumes of emails to an address in an attempt to overflow the mailbox, overwhelm the server where the email address is hosted in a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) or as a smoke screen to distract the attention from important email messages indicating a security breach.

# Pre-requisites
If an app or site doesn’t meet Google's security standards, Google might block anyone who’s trying to sign in to your account from it. Less secure apps can make it easier for hackers to get in to your account, so blocking sign-ins from these apps helps keep your account safe. We recommend you create a Pseudo account in order to use this. 
After you make your Account, go to https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps and set Allow Less Secure Apps turned to Off.
