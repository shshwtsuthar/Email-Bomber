# Email-Bomber
In Internet usage, an email bomb is a form of sending large volumes of emails to an address in an attempt to overflow the mailbox, overwhelm the server where the email address is hosted in a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) or as a smoke screen to distract the attention from important email messages indicating a security breach.
